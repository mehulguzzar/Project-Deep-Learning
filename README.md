# Project-Deep-Learning

Mini Project implemented as part of the Deep Learning course in MTech

## Background

Self-driving cars are gaining traction with the advancement in research in the fields of AI and Deep Learning and the future of mobility is headed towards complete autonomy with no input from the passengers, and the vehicle being able to manuever itself and take decisions independently. But to achieve level 5 autonomy, it is necessary for vehicles to understand and follow all the rules of the road.

In the world of Artificial Intelligence, many researchers and big companies like Tesla, Uber, Google, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, Ford, Audi, etc are working on autonomous vehicles and self-driving cars. In order to make this technology completely autonomous and road legal, the vehicles should be able to interpret traffic signs and make decisions accordingly.

There are several different types of traffic signs like speed limits, no entry, traffic signals, turn left or right, children crossing, no passing of heavy vehicles, etc. Traffic signs classification is the process of identifying which class a traffic sign belongs to. In this deep learning project, we will build a deep neural network model that can classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories. With this model, we are able to read and understand traffic signs which are a very important task for all autonomous vehicles.

## Dataset Description:

For this project, we are using the public dataset available at Kaggle.

The dataset contains about 39,000 images of different traffic signs. It is further classified into 43 different classes. The description of each class is as given below:

0: Speed limit (20km/h) 1: Speed limit (30km/h) 2: Speed limit (50km/h) 3: Speed limit (60km/h) 4: Speed limit (70km/h) 5: Speed limit (80km/h) 6: End of speed limit (80km/h) 7: Speed limit (100km/h) 8: Speed limit (120km/h) 9: No passing 10: No passing veh over 3.5 tons 11: Right-of-way at intersection 12: Priority road 13: Yield 14: Stop 15: No vehicles 16: Veh > 3.5 tons prohibited 17: No entry 18: General caution 19: Dangerous curve left 20: Dangerous curve right 21: Double curve 22: Bumpy road 23: Slippery road 24: Road narrows on the right 25: Road work 26: Traffic signals 27: Pedestrians 28: Children crossing 29: Bicycles crossing 30: Beware of ice/snow 31: Wild animals crossing 32: End speed + passing limits 33: Turn right ahead 34: Turn left ahead 35: Ahead only 36: Go straight or right 37: Go straight or left 38: Keep right 39: Keep left 40: Roundabout mandatory 41: End of no passing 42: End no passing veh > 3.5 tons
